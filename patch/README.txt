Fix for XSLT component issue with v2.8.0-fuse-01-06: https://fusesource.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=12367&#12367

    Put the patched jar into $ESB_HOME/system/org/apache/camel/camel-core/2.8.0-fuse-01-06, then you need to delete all
    the files in $ESB_HOME/data before you start the Fuse ESB again.
